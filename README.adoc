== Introduction

Zesta Ads is a revolutionary ad network designed to address the fundamental problems of modern digital advertising. Our mission is to create a sustainable and effective advertising ecosystem that respects user experience while delivering value to advertisers and publishers.

The current advertising landscape is plagued with issues such as:

*   **Intrusive Ads:** Ads that disrupt the user's flow and create a negative experience.
*   **Privacy Concerns:** Opaque data collection practices that erode user trust.
*   **Poor UI Integration:** Ads that feel out of place and degrade the quality of the user interface.

Zesta Ads tackles these challenges by leveraging cutting-edge AI to deliver ads that are not only effective but also interactive, appealing, and seamlessly integrated into the user experience.

== Core Concepts

*   **Generative AI:** We use generative AI to create ads that are more engaging and interactive than traditional ad formats.
*   **Personalization:** Our platform uses fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver personalized ad content that is relevant to the user.
*   **UI-Respecting Ads:** Our ads are designed to respect the user interface and integrate seamlessly with the surrounding content.
*   **Text and Image-based Ads:** We support both text and image-based ad formats, providing flexibility for advertisers.
