== Introduction

Zesta Ads is a revolutionary ad network designed to address the fundamental problems of modern digital advertising. Our mission is to create a sustainable and effective advertising ecosystem that respects user experience while delivering value to advertisers and publishers.

The current advertising landscape is plagued with issues such as:

*   **Intrusive Ads:** Ads that disrupt the user's flow and create a negative experience.
*   **Privacy Concerns:** Opaque data collection practices that erode user trust.
*   **Poor UI Integration:** Ads that feel out of place and degrade the quality of the user interface.

Zesta Ads tackles these challenges by leveraging cutting-edge AI to deliver ads that are not only effective but also interactive, appealing, and seamlessly integrated into the user experience.

== Core Concepts

*   **Generative AI:** We use generative AI to create ads that are more engaging and interactive than traditional ad formats.
*   **Personalization:** Our platform uses fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver personalized ad content that is relevant to the user.
*   **UI-Respecting Ads:** Our ads are designed to respect the user interface and integrate seamlessly with the surrounding content.
*   **Text and Image-based Ads:** We support both text and image-based ad formats, providing flexibility for advertisers.

== Architecture

The Zesta Ads platform is built on a modern, scalable architecture. The following diagram illustrates the core components of our system.

....
digraph ZestaAds {
    rankdir=LR;
    node [shape=box, style=rounded];

    subgraph "Problems" {
        node [shape=plaintext];
        Intrusive_Ads [label="Intrusive Ads"];
        Data_Collection [label="Privacy Concerns"];
        UI_Integration [label="Poor UI Integration"];
    }

    subgraph "Zesta Ads Platform" {
        subgraph "Product" {
            Gen_AI [label="Generative AI\n(Interactive & Appealling)"];
            Personalization [label="Personalization\n(Fine-tuned LLM)"];
            Ad_Formats [label="Ad Formats\n(Text & Image)"];
        }

        subgraph "Backend" {
            Bidding_System [label="Bidding System"];
            Developer_API [label="Developer API"];
        }

        Gen_AI -> Personalization;
        Personalization -> Ad_Formats;
        Bidding_System -> Developer_API;
    }

    subgraph "Stakeholders" {
        node [shape=ellipse];
        Advertisers;
        Publishers;
        Consumers;
    }

    Advertisers -> Bidding_System;
    Publishers -> Developer_API;
    Ad_Formats -> Consumers;
}
